## Integrations
### 1. Database
The application integrates with a MariaDB relational database.</br>
Scripts to create the database schema can be found in the migrations folder and are run automatically by docker-compose.

### 2. Student
The application integrates with the [Student microservice](https://github.com/tvergilio/student) via REST.
1. When a student is created, a request is sent to this application to create an account.
2. When a student enrols in a course, a request is sent to this application to create an invoice.
3. When checking the eligibility to graduate, a request is sent to this application to see if there are any outstanding invoices.

### 3. Library
The application integrates with the [Library microservice](https://github.com/AidanCurley/CESBooks) via REST.
1. When a book is returned late, a fine is issued. A request is sent to this application to create an invoice.
2. The invoice must be paid via this application's Payment Portal.
